# Alpha-Zero Symbolic Regression
This branch represents the first attempt to use the Alpha-Zero algorithm, in our case using the [alpha-zero-general](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general) repo, to tacke the symbolic regression problem. One can set the complexity (number of tokens) in the expression by passing in the desired complexity to the Game constructor, i.e., ``Game(10)`` to set the number of tokens in the generated (infix) expressions to 10. See the example files: ``grad_test.py``, ``main_symreg.py``, and ``multi_dimensional_symreg_test.py`` for some tutorials. 
The approach to generating infix expressions is pretty naive; we let the Alpha-Zero backend select tokens and then we have [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) try to parse it, and if it fails, we pop one token at a time until sympy can parse it.
