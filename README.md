# Alpha-Zero Symbolic Regression
This branch represents an attempt to use the Alpha-Zero algorithm, in our case using the [alpha-zero-general](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general) repo, to tacke the symbolic regression problem using prefix and postfix grammars. One can set the complexity (depth of expression tree) in the expression by passing in the desired complexity to the Game constructor, i.e., ``Game(10, "postfix")`` to set the depth of the generated postfix expressions to 10, or ``"prefix"`` for prefix. See the example files: ``grad_test.py``, ``main_symreg.py``, and ``multi_dimensional_symreg_test.py`` for some tutorials. 
The approach to generating prefix and postfix expressions uses grammars to ensure that any expression of the exact depth that the user specifies (with the defined operators) can be generated. This particular branch uses Numba to try and optimize some of the slower parts of the code, but in practice doesn't result in any significant improvements.
